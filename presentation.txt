# Elexon BMRS Analysis Dashboard - Presentation Script

## For Welsh Power Graduate Quantitative Trading Analyst Interview

---

## 🎯 Introduction (1-2 minutes)

> "Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to present my mini project. 
>
> Today I'll be demonstrating an interactive dashboard I built to analyse UK energy market data using the **Elexon BMRS API**. This project showcases the key skills mentioned in the job description:  **data and API management**, **statistical analysis**, and the ability to **effectively develop and present insights**.
>
> The dashboard consolidates three separate analysis scripts I developed into a single, user-friendly interface that allows for dynamic exploration of energy market data."

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview (2-3 minutes)

### Opening the Dashboard

> "Let me walk you through the dashboard.  On the left, you'll see the **configuration panel** where users can: 
>
> - Select a **date range** (up to 7 days, which is the Elexon API limit)
> - Choose specific **settlement periods** (each representing a 30-minute interval)
> - Select the type of **analysis** they want to perform
>
> The dashboard fetches **real-time data** from the Elexon BMRS API, so we're always working with the latest available information."

### Demonstrate the Controls

1. **Adjust the date range** - Show how the validation prevents selecting more than 7 days
2. **Adjust settlement periods** - Explain that periods 1-48 cover a full day (48 × 30 minutes = 24 hours)
3. **Click "Fetch Data & Analyse"** - Show the loading spinner and success messages

---

## 📈 Analysis 1: Load Prediction (3-4 minutes)

> "The first analysis uses a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict electricity demand for the next 48 settlement periods—that's the next 24 hours. 
>
> This is directly relevant to Welsh Power's trading operations, where accurate demand forecasting helps optimise when to dispatch flexible generation assets."

### Key Points to Highlight:

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Model MAE** | Average prediction error in MW - lower is better |
| **Model RMSE** | Penalises larger errors more heavily |
| **Persistence MAE** | Baseline comparison (naïve "tomorrow = today" forecast) |
| **Improvement vs Baseline** | How much better our model performs |

> "As you can see, the Random Forest model achieves a **[X]% improvement** over the simple persistence baseline.  This demonstrates that the model is capturing meaningful patterns in the data. 
>
> The **feature importance chart** shows that the **Lag-1 Quantity** (the previous period's demand) is the strongest predictor, which makes intuitive sense—demand tends to be autocorrelated. 
>
> The **time series plot** shows the actual historical load in blue, with our predictions for the next 24 hours shown as an orange dashed line."

### Technical Discussion Points:

- **Why Random Forest?** - Handles non-linear relationships, robust to overfitting, provides feature importance
- **Why StandardScaler?** - Normalises features for better model performance
- **Why lag features?** - Captures temporal autocorrelation in demand data

---

## 🔗 Analysis 2: Regression Analysis (3-4 minutes)

> "The second analysis examines the **relationship between day-ahead demand forecasts and actual realised load**. This is crucial for understanding forecast accuracy and potential trading opportunities.
>
> In energy trading, the spread between forecast and actual demand creates opportunities—if you can predict when forecasts will be wrong, you can position accordingly."

### Key Points to Highlight: 

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **R² Score** | How much variance in actual load is explained by the forecast |
| **Slope** | Should be close to 1.0 for a perfect forecast |
| **Intercept** | Systematic bias in the forecast |
| **Mean Spread** | Average forecast error (positive = under-forecast) |

> "The **R² score of [X]** indicates a [strong/moderate/weak] relationship between forecast and actual demand. The interpretation box explains what this means in practical terms. 
>
> Looking at the **scatter plot**, you can see how closely the data points follow the regression line. A perfect forecast would show all points on the diagonal. 
>
> The **histogram of forecast errors** shows the distribution of spreads.  A well-calibrated forecast would be centred around zero with minimal spread."

### Technical Discussion Points: 

- **Time Series Cross-Validation** - Used `TimeSeriesSplit` to avoid look-ahead bias
- **Spread Analysis** - 5th and 95th percentiles show the range of typical forecast errors
- **Trading Implications** - Large spreads indicate potential trading opportunities

---

## 📊 Analysis 3: Statistical Overview (2-3 minutes)

> "The third analysis provides a **statistical summary** of the data, including today's live forecasts from Elexon. 
>
> This gives traders a quick snapshot of current market conditions and expected demand patterns."

### Key Points to Highlight: 

1. **Descriptive Statistics** - Mean, standard deviation, min/max demand
2. **Load Distribution** - Box plot showing the spread of demand values
3. **Settlement Period Profile** - Shows the typical daily demand curve
4. **Today's Forecasts** - Live data showing expected demand and generation

> "The **settlement period chart** is particularly useful—it shows the typical demand profile throughout the day. You can clearly see the morning ramp-up, the midday plateau, the evening peak, and the overnight trough.
>
> This pattern is important for scheduling flexible generation assets like those Welsh Power operates."

## 💡 Technical Highlights (2-3 minutes)

> "Let me highlight some of the technical decisions I made in building this dashboard:"

### API Integration

> "The Elexon BMRS API provides open-source energy market data. I built a dedicated **API client class** that:
> - Handles connection errors and timeouts gracefully
> - Validates date ranges (max 7 days)
> - Filters data by settlement period client-side for flexibility"

### Data Processing

> "The data processing pipeline: 
> - Converts timestamps and handles timezone issues
> - Coerces data types and handles missing values
> - Calculates derived features like moving averages and spreads"

### Visualisation

> "I chose **Plotly** for visualisation because it provides:
> - Interactive charts (zoom, pan, hover for details)
> - Professional appearance suitable for stakeholder presentations
> - Consistency across all chart types"

### Framework Choice

> "**Streamlit** was chosen because it:
> - Enables rapid prototyping of data applications
> - Provides a clean, professional interface
> - Integrates seamlessly with Python data science libraries"

## 🔄 Live Demonstration (2-3 minutes)

> "Let me demonstrate the dashboard's flexibility with a few scenarios:"

### Scenario 1: Different Date Range

> "If I change the date range to [new dates], you'll see the analysis updates automatically with fresh data from the API."

### Scenario 2: Specific Settlement Periods

> "If I'm only interested in peak demand periods, I can filter to settlement periods 32-40 (roughly 4pm-8pm). Watch how all the analyses update to focus on this period."

### Scenario 3: All Analyses View

> "Selecting 'All Analyses' gives a comprehensive view—useful for a daily morning briefing or preparing for a trading session."
